WE HAVE SET THE PROXY IN PACKAGE.JSON 
SO WE HAVE TO RESTART THE BOTH THE TERMINALS
AND FIRST RUN BACKEND THEN RUIN FRONTEND

we have installed eslint from exetensions 
it helps us to find the error suppose u use data1 not not used it any where then it will give underline in that part and give us error
if we define a variable we are not using in code then we will get highlight that u have not used it

redux is use to manage the state of our application
workflow of redux 
view -->we are using the component 
PRVIOUSLY WE HAVE SENT THE AJAX REQUEST TO BACKEND TO GET THE LIST OF PRODUCTS
IN REDUX WE ARE GOING TO GET PRODUCTS FROM BACKEND AND PUT THEM IN REDUX STATE INSTEAD OF COMPONNET STATE
IT WILL START IN THIS WAY-->
DISPTACH ACTION IN VIEW PART
THIS ACTION SENT REQUEST TO REDUX STORE TO MAKE CHANGE IN STATE OF OUR application
SO TO REQUEST STATE CHANGE WE NEED TO CREATE AN ACTION AND HAVE TO DISPATCH THE ACTION
IN STORE OF REDUX WE HAVE TWO THINGS STATE AND REDUCER
STATE IS CURRENT STATE OF OUR APPLICATION 
AND REDUCER IS FUNCTION IS THAT GET CURRENT STATE AND MAKE CHANGE IN STATE AND RETURN THE NEW STATTE
BY HAVING HISTORY OF STATE WE CAN WHETHER MANAGE AND PREDICT THE STATE OF OUR APLICATION AND THERE IS NO UNPREDICATABLE STATUS IN OUR CODE
 can refer to redux workflow picture for more clarification
